# Mandarin
Mandarin is a package manager for the web, it delivers packages from scratch.mit.edu inside of a compact form with high performance. For certain packages, you can choose to either get a raw package (html) or get an embed that hotlinks back to the repository (Turbowarp).

# Where do you get your packages?
We get our embeds and packages from https://turbowarp.org, an open-source packager for scratch projects coming from https://scratch.mit.edu.

We grab the embeds from turbowarp and then package them up on our website for you to pick and choose from for your website.
